# üí° About the project 

<p>
  This is a Design System library that is published as a npm package and anyone can use it by installing the npm package manager.

  In this project I created buttons, fonts, margins, colors, spacing between boxes and much more. It is a complete Design System project to style any project without having to worry about styling in the development phase of an application.

  This approach makes a development team save time and focus on the essential requirements of an application.
